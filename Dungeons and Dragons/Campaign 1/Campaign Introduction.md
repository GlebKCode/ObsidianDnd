Well, folks, dire times call for dire measures (or however that phrase goes). Can't exactly get our best on hand, but this group should do. Yes, yes, you haven't worked with each other yet, nor do you have that trust established, but you're all **Greenfelds**, and that bond is stronger than any other!

Listen up, that old bastard, **Iltigmire**, ratted out one of our top financiers. His majesty, **Alafore**, has set him up for execution in **Rimaveny Square**. There are of course, a couple others up for their demise at that same time, and I reckon there's no better time to recruit people to our group than the moment they're spared from death! 

In short: rescue **Guttinson Bandy** (you'll be able to point out his weaselly ass from a mile away), along with the couple others if you can, and bring them to point D-23. We can escort them underground from there.

As usual, figure it all out, I was never good at the specifics!

Hugs and Kisses~,
**Zanks**
