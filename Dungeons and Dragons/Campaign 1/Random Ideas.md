# Main Plot
Beholder, smart dude, has a moat of Aboleths surrounding  dwelling- 3 heroes possessed immediately by aboleths, crushing defeat.   Jun's character was born out of one of the mind-controlled fucking a citizen as an experiment. The beholder gave strict instruction not to go outside of the plan, aboleth is panicking and trying to kill her, while also making it a good thing for the beholder that they are dying. 
Planar chaos??? Confluence?? could explain Ilm coming into existence, and could explain the aboleths circling his domain - lots of planar fuckery, partially caused by the magic poured into Nuilu Ana's core - very closely connected with the Elemental Plane of Fire
**Planar Piercing Rifle** - created by an artificer long ago, plane's were colliding and this allowed him to shoot through them, destroying anything on the other side. very powerful weapon. SHOOTING THROUGH PLANES? LIKE HELLO? THATS FUCKING AWESOME??? Unfortunately it was lost to time.
PLANAR FUCKERY IS GOING TO BE A THEME YIIPPPEEE. This shit is going to be known for very few. Also artificer's constructs will be used by the millitary, they've been discovered.
